My personal portfolio made with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

This was based off my [NextJS Boilerplate Essentials](https://github.com/Dovalization/next-boilerplate-essentials) template, check it out for more info. I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions!

Design and development by yours truly.
